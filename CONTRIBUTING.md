## Technical Architecture

Understanding the codebase:

### Main Process (`main.js`)
- Handles IPC communication
- Manages FCM credentials
- Fetches item data from Corrosion Hour
- Connects to Rust+ servers
- Stores server data locally

### Renderer Process (`renderer.js`)
- UI logic and event handling
- Filtering and searching
- Theme management
- Display formatting

### Preload Script (`preload.js`)
- Secure bridge between main and renderer
- Exposes safe IPC methods via `window.electronAPI`

### Key Dependencies
- `@liamcottle/rustplus.js` - Rust+ protocol
- `@liamcottle/push-receiver` - FCM notifications
- `cheerio` - HTML parsing for item data
